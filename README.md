# laravel-support-helpers

Helper methods in the spirit of Laravel's native `Arr` and `Str`.

# Installation

```shell
composer require brekitomasson/laravel-support-helpers
```

# Usage

While this package doesn't _technically_ require you to use it in a Laravel context, it was developed with Laravel in mind and uses Laravel's 
`Illuminate\Support\Collection` under the hood in a number of places.
